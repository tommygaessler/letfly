## Inspiration
Use SendGrid, FullContact, and Amazon's Alexa to make email fun and more productive!

## What it does
Use your voice to send emails!

## How I built it
I built an Amazon Alexa skill by integrating the SendGrid and FullContact API's into a Node.js/Express app!

## Challenges we ran into
Learning to build an Alexa skill in one day, and my partner having to leave early.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being able to give Alexa a name, and have her find the email to that name in my FullContact address book, and send that person an email via SendGrid.

##
What we learned
I learned how to make Amazon Alexa Skills, and how important sleep is.

## What's next for Hacker's Delight
We are raising a series A early next year!
