# LetFly

## Use SendGrid, FullContact, and Alexa to make email fun and productive!

## Use your voice to send emails!

## I built an Amazon Alexa skill by integrating the SendGrid and FullContact API's into a Node.js/Express app!

## Learning to build an Alexa skill in one day, and my partner having to leave early.

## Being able to give Alexa a name, and have her find the email to that name in my FullContact address book, and send that person an email via SendGrid.

## I learned how to make Amazon Alexa Skills, and how important sleep is.

## We are raising a series A early next year!
